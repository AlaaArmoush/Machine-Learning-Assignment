This notebook demonstrates how basic machine learning techniques can be applied to understand and predict user behavior across three domains: smart home energy usage, music listening on Spotify, and game preferences on Steam. Using real-world datasets, it shows how clustering, similarity-based recommendations, and collaborative filtering can uncover patterns and power personalized experiences.
